# BMI Calculator App - README

## Overview
This is a Flutter-based BMI Calculator app that allows users to input their height and weight to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). It features a dynamic UI that updates BMI categories, provides weight loss/gain suggestions, and maintains responsiveness.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  syncfusion_flutter_gauges: ^21.1.39
```

Install dependencies using:
```sh
flutter pub get
```

## Features Implemented

1. **Dynamic Font Color for BMI Categories**
   - Underweight: **Blue**
   - Normal Weight: **Green**
   - Overweight: **Orange**
   - Obesity: **Red**

2. **BMI Display Updates Correctly**
   - Displays "Your BMI: 0.0" when height/weight changes.
   - Displays calculated BMI only after clicking the "Calculate BMI" button.

3. **Weight Loss Message (Red Background)**
   - Appears only when BMI is in the overweight or obesity range.
   - Displays how much weight needs to be lost to reach a normal BMI.

4. **Normal Weight Message (Green Background)**
   - Displays "You have a perfect BMI" when BMI is in the normal range.

5. **Underweight Message (Blue Background)**
   - Displays "You need to gain X kg to reach normal BMI" when BMI is under 18.5.

6. **UI Responsiveness**
   - All messages reset when the user changes height or weight.
   - The category name remains visible but updates dynamically.

## How to Run the App

2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run:
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

## Notes
